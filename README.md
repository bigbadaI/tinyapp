# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Project asked for couple weird cases like logging out redirect to /urls which according to instructions should "returns HTML with a relevant error message" which seemed weird in my opinion so I decided to add a Welcome page to fix some of those weird cases I hope this is alright solution.
